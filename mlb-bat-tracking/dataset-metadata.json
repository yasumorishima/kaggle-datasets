Bat Tracking is a new Statcast feature introduced in 2024 that measures batter swing characteristics using high-speed cameras.\n\n## Dataset Contents\n\n- **452 batters** (226 per season)\n- **19 columns** including:\n  - `avg_bat_speed`: Average bat speed at impact (mph)\n  - `swing_length`: Distance the bat head travels during the swing (feet)\n  - `squared_up_per_bat_contact`: Percentage of well-struck balls\n  - `hard_swing_rate`: Percentage of swings with high bat speed\n  - `blast_per_bat_contact`: Percentage of balls hit with ideal launch conditions\n  - `swords`: Swings and misses on pitches outside the zone\n  - `batter_run_value`: Runs created above/below average\n\n## Data Source\n\nData is sourced from [Baseball Savant](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/leaderboard/bat-tracking), MLB's official Statcast data platform.\n\n## Usage Ideas\n\n- Compare swing mechanics across different player types\n- Analyze correlation between bat speed and power metrics\n- Identify swing efficiency patterns (swing length vs contact rate)\n- Build predictive models for batting performance\n- Year-over-year player development analysis (2024 vs 2025)\n\n## Column Descriptions\n\n| Column | Description |\n|--------|-------------|\n| `id` | Baseball Savant player ID |\n| `name` | Player name |\n| `swings_competitive` | Number of competitive swings |\n| `percent_swings_competitive` | Percentage of swings that are competitive |\n| `contact` | Number of times contact was made |\n| `avg_bat_speed` | Average bat speed (mph) |\n| `hard_swing_rate` | Rate of swings with high bat speed |\n| `squared_up_per_bat_contact` | Rate of squared-up balls per contact |\n| `squared_up_per_swing` | Rate of squared-up balls per swing |\n| `blast_per_bat_contact` | Rate of ideal launch per contact |\n| `blast_per_swing` | Rate of ideal launch per swing |\n| `swing_length` | Average swing length (feet) |\n| `swords` | Swings and misses outside the zone |\n| `batter_run_value` | Runs created above/below average |\n| `whiffs` | Total swings and misses |\n| `whiff_per_swing` | Rate of swings and misses |\n| `batted_ball_events` | Number of batted ball events |\n| `batted_ball_event_per_swing` | Rate of batted balls per swing |\n| `season` | Season year (2024 or 2025) |\n\n## License\n\nCC0: Public Domain.
